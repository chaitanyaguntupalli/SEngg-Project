# SEngg-Project

## Abstract
The current project status report encapsulates our research endeavors centered on ChatGPT's interactions within the developer community, focusing on three pivotal areas. The first area of investigation involves a comprehensive analysis of programming language queries posed to ChatGPT, with an emphasis on identifying temporal shifts in language preferences. This segment is currently in the data collection and extraction phase. The second aspect delves into the variability of conversation lengths with ChatGPT, contingent upon the nature of the issues presented. This involves a methodical categorization of conversation types, a process that is presently being refined. The final facet of our research is concentrated on pinpointing the most prevalent prompts directed at ChatGPT by developers and critically analyzing the AI's response mechanisms. For this, we are in the initial stages of a thorough data mining exercise. The research utilizes sophisticated data analysis tools and adheres strictly to ethical standards in data handling. As we progress, we anticipate generating actionable insights, with subsequent updates planned to chronicle ongoing developments in this multifaceted research initiative.
